## 1. Deploy Ambassador

There are multiple methods for deploying Ambassador. You can see a list of them and other upgrade guides [here](https://www.getambassador.io/user-guide/install/).

For the sake of the exercise we will follow two different deployment strategies. The easy way and the not-so-easy way (don't worry both are pretty easy).

### The Easy Way

First we will do the easy way. You can find instructions for this method [here](https://www.getambassador.io/user-guide/getting-started/).

### The not-so-easy Way

Now we will deploy the more traditional way using YAML manifests

You will find everything you need to deploy Ambassador in the `ambassador/` directory. Simply apply these manifests to deploy Ambassador the "traditional" way.

#### Questions

What command should you run to install the software?

What is the IP address of the Ambassador service?
