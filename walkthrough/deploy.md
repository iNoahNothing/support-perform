##  Install the application

All of the configuration files have again been provided for you in the `api/` directory. 

# Questions

### How do you know the application has been properly installed?

### What port is the application listening on? What port is the `Service` listening on?

### How can we access this application without Ambassador Edge Stack? Do it.
